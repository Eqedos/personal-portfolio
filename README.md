## Description

My portfolio website is an interactive, OS-themed portfolio website designed to showcase software development projects in a unique, engaging way. It simulates an operating system environment with a functioning terminal, file explorer, and other desktop-like features, offering users an immersive experience as they explore the portfolio.

Built with JavaScript and React, this website is not only a portfolio but also a testament to modern web development capabilities. It's a live demonstration of using React to create dynamic, responsive user interfaces with a twist.

## Features

- **Functional Terminal**: A terminal that accepts commands and showcases projects, skills, and more.
- **Dynamic Window Management**: Mimic the behavior of a desktop OS with draggable and resizable windows.
- **Theme Customization**: Users can choose from various themes, replicating different OS looks.
- **!Mobile Responsiveness**: Due the desktop OS theme, the site is not responsive on mobile devices. Although a mobile version is on it's way!
